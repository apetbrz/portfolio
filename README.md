# Portfolio

My little slice of the internet :)

## Requirements

- `todo!()`
- `tmux`

## Scripts

- `dev` runs dev environment: server + vite + bacon
- `build` builds client for release
- `clean:dev` deletes all dev build binaries (debug WASM, primarily)
- `clean:release` deletes all built release files (`dist/`, `release/`, etc)
